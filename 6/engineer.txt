1945: O Engenheiro (The Engineer)

The light, the sun, the open air
envelope the dream of the engineer.
The engineer dreams bright things:
surfaces, tennis, a glass of water.

The pencil, the carpenter’s square, the paper;
the design, the project, the number:
the engineer thinks the world just,
world which no veil conceals.

(On certain afternoons we’d go up
into the building. The everyday city
like a newspaper that everyone read,
acquired a lung of cement and glass.)

The water, the wind, the brightness,
to one side, the river, on high, the clouds
situated the building in nature
growing from its simple forces.
